gdm (2.26.1-0ubuntu5) karmic; urgency=low

  * debian/gdm.preinst: Remove obsolete conffiles.
  * debian/gdm.preinst: Migrate autologin settings from gdm.conf (which isn't
    read any more) to custom.conf. (LP: #396459)
  * Add 81_initial_server_on_vt7.patch: Force initial X server to go to tty7
    instead of tty1. This is an Ugly Hack until we have a cleaner solution for
    getty not to tramp over a running X server on vt1. This bandaids the
    immediate problem of the first X server being killed after a few minutes
    due to getty on tty1 timing out. (LP: #396226)

gdm (2.26.1-0ubuntu4) karmic; urgency=low

  * debian/gdm.preinst: Do not check for an existing custom.conf, since we
    already ship it. Always let the gdm.conf-custom win, to actually migrate
    settings.
  * debian/control: Drop alternative dependencies for gnome-session, since gdm
    itself now needs gnome-session. (LP: #396321).

gdm (2.26.1-0ubuntu3) karmic; urgency=low

  * Add 03_hide_system_users.patch: Do not show system users in the "frequent
    users" list. (LP: #395281)
  * debian/rules: Call dh_installinit with --no-scripts, to avoid restarting
    gdm (and killing your X session) during upgrade. The prerm/postinst
    scripts already have code to reload gdm if appropriate. Unfortunately this
    doesn't help to fix the upgrade from 0ubuntu2, its prerm already kills it.
    (LP: #395302) This also fixes the "locks session and spawns a second X
    server" issue on upgrades from Jaunty. (LP: #395313)
  * Drop 16_correct_customconf_naming.patch: Upstream uses
    and installs /etc/gdm/custom.conf, so gdm also needs to read this. Add
    debian/gdm.preinst to migrate the old name to the new name on upgrades.
    (LP: #395861)
  * 02_dont_force_us_keyboard.patch: Don't return NULL in
    get_default_layout(), but return an empty string and explicitly check this
    when setting $GDM_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT. With NULL, gdm trips over an assertion
    check. (LP: #395595)

gdm (2.26.1-0ubuntu2) karmic; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Add Vcs-Bzr, package imported into bzr.
  * Add 02_dont_force_us_keyboard.patch: Don't force GDM_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT=us if
    gdm does not have an explicit setting (which it currently doesn't, since
    there is not even an interface for changing the keyboard layout). Instead,
    let the GNOME session default to the very same system default as gdm
    itself. (LP: #395103)

gdm (2.26.1-0ubuntu1) karmic; urgency=low

  * Upload the new gdm codebase to karmic, there is several known issues but
    the new version need testing:
    - there is no graphical configure tool yet
    - gdm will not work correctly after upgrade until restart (restarting on
      upgrade is not possible since it would close running xsession)
    - the fast user switch applet ubuntu changes and the guest session
      have not been updated yet

gdm (2.26.1-0ubuntu0.3) karmic; urgency=low

gdm (2.26.1-0ubuntu0.2) karmic; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/17_update_default_xserver.patch:
    - update xserver location
  * debian/gdm.init: use the correct binary naming so restart is working

gdm-new (2.25.2-0ubuntu0.1) intrepid; urgency=low
