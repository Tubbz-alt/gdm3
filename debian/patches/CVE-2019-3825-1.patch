Subject: [PATCH] manager: don't kill timed login session immediately after it
 starts

At the moment GDM is misidentifying timed login sessions as if
they are automatic login sessions.  That leads to their displays
getting killed sometimes shortly after log in.

This commit corrects the check, so that timed login sessions aren't
treated as autologin sessions.
