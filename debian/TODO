 * Check that a user logged on a tty is not considered as logged on 
   (previously fixed by 08_frequent-users_greeter.patch)
 * Restore 11_xephyr_nested.patch
   + Needs to be made compatible with the xhost stuff
   + Donâ€™t forget to add back the necessary code in 
     20_endsession_respawn.patch and 19_configure_xserver.patch
 * Restore 14_pam_dialog.patch if still needed
 * Handle the DConf stuff in a more flexible way, allowing for system 
   overrides like for GConf.
 * Set some sensible DConf defaults accordingly.
