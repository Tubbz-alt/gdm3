Description: Next generation GNOME Display Manager
 GDM provides the equivalent of a "login:" prompt for X displays: it 
 asks for a login and starts X sessions.
 .
 It provides all the functionality of XDM, including XDMCP support for
 managing remote displays, and extends it with the ability to start X 
 servers on demand.
 .
 The greeter is written using the GNOME libraries and hence looks like a 
 GNOME application - even to the extent of supporting themes! 
 .
 This package contains the next generation GDM, which was developed 
 using the technologies on which GNOME 3 is based.
