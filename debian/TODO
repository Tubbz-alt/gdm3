Remaining important issues with GDM3:

 * The background picture and the bottom bar take ages to display.

 * There’s a race condition that will often prevent the xsettings 
   manager in g-s-d to start up in the user’s session.

 * In a nested session, the greeter selects the US keyboard by default.

 * gdmsetup spews debug information.
