gdm (2.30.2-0ubuntu1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release:
    - Accessibility is now enabled by default for the GDM login screen.
    - When the face browser is disabled, the PAM conversation is started
      immediately, so users do not need to click a button to start entering
      the username and password.  (GNOME #591082)
    - Add label-for and labelled-by a11y relations to the entry field in the
      login GUI.  This makes the login GUI more accessible when using AT programs.
      (GNOME #613434).
    - Fixed bugs that were causing XDMCP to not show the greeter again after
      logout.  (GNOME #606724).
    - The default XDMCP PingIntervalSeconds was increased from 15 to
      60 seconds.
    - The WINDOWPATH environment variable is now set for the user session.
      (GNOME #609272)
    - Ensure Init script is called when using Automatic Login. (GNOME #614488)
    - Fix race condition with Timed Login. (GNOME #614062)
    - Drop xhost localuser:gdm and localuser:root when the user session starts.
      (GNOME #605350)
    - Removed the icon monitor from the GDM login GUI since it was not functional
      and was causing problems with automounting user's $HOME directories.
      (GNOME #609321, LP: #518810)
    - Do not mark "%x" for translation. (GNOME #613306)
    - Remove duplicated strings for translation. (GNOME #609179)
    - Minor doc corrections.
    - Translation updates.
  * 04_fix_external_program_directories.patch, 99_autoreconf.patch: Refresh
    for new upstream version.
  * Add 34_disable_a11y_default.patch: Revert upstream change between 2.30.0
    and 2.30.1 to enable a11y by default. This wasn't tested and isn't
    appropriate for an SRU.
  * 06_run_xsession.d.patch: Export $USERXSESSION, $USERXSESSIONRC, and
    $ALTUSERXSESSION, so that running the "custom"/"default" sessions actually
    works. Without those, /etc/X11/Xsession.d/50x11-common_determine-startup
    decides to run the system default session even if we have the
    "allow-user-xsession" option. This is a prerequisite for fixing LP#398300.
    Also update the patch tag header to comply to DEP-3.
  * Add debian/xsession.desktop: Add a new session type "~/.xsession" which
    will run ~/.xsession (Exec=default will be interpreted by the
    20x11-common_process-args and 50x11-common_determine-startup Xsession.d
    scripts). If the admin sets "allow-user-xsession" to False, this will
    launch the system default session instead. (LP: #398300)

      just tell it to quit and don't continue with the transition -- start
      gdm on a new vt

      This solves the issue of just re-using the active VT when Plymouth
      hasn't even shown a splash screen yet; resulting in X running on VT1
      alongside the X server.

  * New upsteam release:
    - The greeter is not torn down until pam_open_session finishes since
      some PAM modules can ask questions up until this point.
    - The daemon now kills the session process rather than the entire process
      group, fixing bug #607738. The corresponding gnome-session bug #607658
       is released with 2.29.92 so this works properly.
  * debian/patches/04_fix_external_program_directories.patch: adapt to

  * Add 18_locale_env_vars.patch: gdm does not have a facility to specify a
    list of languages for $LANGUAGE, so do not break $LANGUAGE by forcing it
    to $LANG (they have a completely different syntax, and different
    meanings). Also, if the system sets $LC_ALL (which distros should never
    ever do), we should not clobber this.  $LINGUAS is not a runtime
    environment variable for locales, so just drop this.  (LP: #407300)

    28_plymouth_transition.patch introduces an alternative startup function.

      plymouth out of the way in case the X server doesn't start.
  * debian/gdm.upstart:
    - Remove "starting-dm" event; the above patch means we handle
      stopping the splash screen gracefully by ourselves so don't need
      it.
    - Only look at /etc/X11/default-display-manager and /proc/cmdline
      when started automatically; always allow "start gdm" to work.
    - Use the PRIMARY_DEVICE_FOR_DISPLAY tag on the framebuffer or
      drm card devices to start the X server, still falling back on
      end of udev probing (we may have neither).  Drop the tty
      part, we need both more and less than this.  LP: #491162.

  * New upstream release:
    [ 2.29.1 ]
    - A new desktop extension is now supported in GDM session desktop files
      (normally found in /usr/share/xsessions). Setting the key to true as follows:
       X-GDM_BypassXsession=true
      will cause the Xsession script to not be used to launch the session.  This
      can be useful if you want to create a "failsafe" xterm session.  The Xsession
      script sources the user's $HOME/.profile, for example, so setting this key
      to true will ensure that any errors in the user's $HOME/.profile will not
      cause the session to fail to start.
    - Fix makedist problem.
    [ 2.29.0 ]
    - Now GDM supports Include, Exclude, and IncludeAll configuration options to
      allow the ability to configure which users are displayed in the FaceBrowser.
    - Now GDM supports better debugging.  Users can set the debug/Enable
      configuration option to turn on GDM debugging.
    - The directory where GDM screenshots are placed has been moved to its own
      directory: /var/run/gdm/greeter/GDM-Screenshot.png.  The screenshot directory
      can now be specified at build time via the --with-screenshot-dir configure
      argument.
    - Many simple-greeter Face Browser usability improvements.
    - The simple-greeter Face Browser tree view search entry is now obscured to
      help prevent accidental display of passwords.
    - Shutdown and reboot functions are moved to a menu in the simple-greeter panel
      instead of being presented as buttons.  The shutdown menu is better
      positioned on multi-monitor displays.
    - The simple-greeter panel notification area has been improved and now honors
      the GConf setting for /apps/notification_area_applet/prefs/padding.
    - The entry field in the simple-greeter now has accessibility labels so it will
      work better with accessibility programs.
    - The clock in the simple-greeter panel no longer shows the date, making the
      screen look a little cleaner.  The date is moved to the clock tooltip so it
      is still available.
    - The simple-greeter now uses gethostname instead of g_get_host_name since
      is more reliable when the hostname changes at runtime.
    - The user switch applet now honors disable_lock_screen.  The option to lock
      screen is now not shown if disable_lock_screen is set.
    - The /var/run/gdm directory is better locked down.
    - GDM no longer crashes on bad UTF-8 in the /etc/passwd file.
    - When the worker dies, the auth-failed signal is no longer sent.  This 
      prevents a crash that happens when switching run-levels when the login screen
      is displayed.
    - Ensure that the length of sockaddr structure is set to the correct length for
      IPv4 or IPv6.  This makes GDM work better on some operating systems that are
      picky about the length being exact.
    - String and documentation improvements.

      at-spi-registryd directly instead of calling at-spi-registryd-wrapper.
    - Fix to the visibility check for the "Other" button which corrects some

    - Now the GDM daemon will make the /var/log/gdm directory if it does not
      exist.
    - Fixes to avoid autologin failure when a NULL username is passed in.

  * New upstream release (LP: #434354)
    - Now GDM supports the ability to specify the automatic/timed login user via
      a script via the same interface that the old GDM supported.
    - Now the user's dmrc and face image files are stored in /var/cache/gdm, so 
      that the login process does not need to access the user's $HOME directory 
      before authentication.
    - Fix the login GUI options widget so the language/session/layout choices
      are not reset after a failed login.
    - Fix language dialog so it does not crash if the user click's the "OK"
      button when no language is selected.
    - Fix to ensure that the login dialog regains focus after the language or
      layout dialogs are used.
    - The language dialog has improved logic to sort the language names more
      correctly.
    - Make sure to check error variable is not NULL before referencing it in the
      gdm-user-manager code.
    - Make sure to not print NULL strings since this causes crashes on some
      platforms.
    - Improve documentation.

  * Update to latest upstream git head:
    - Make greeter login window be a dock. Fixes metacity complaining about
      session management. (LP: #395324)
  * Drop patches which are fixed upstream:
    - 00git-greeter-session-management.patch
    - 00git-invalid-dmrc-layout.patch
    - 00git-use-after-free.patch
    - 00git-xklavier4.patch
    - 02_dont_force_us_keyboard.patch
    - 04_polkit1.patch
  * 80_workaround_incorrect_directories.patch: Update to new upstream version.
  * Drop 01_xconfigoptions.patch; these configure variables are not used any
    more in the upstream code, and upstream supplies the X.org -br option by
    default now. Also drop the corresponding configure changes from
    17_update_default_xserver.patch.
  * Apply 15_usplash.patch to debian/gdm.init and drop the patch.
  * 17_update_default_xserver.patch: Update to new upstream version, add
    corresponding configure change, add patch tag header, forward upstream,
    and rename to 02_x_server_location.patch.
  * Drop 99_autoreconf.patch. The only remaining build system change is the
    previous item.
  * Drop 20_xdm-stuff.patch, it's just cruft.
  * Drop debian/Xsession, and change debian/rules to install the upstream one.
  * 01_xrdb_nocpp.patch: Add patch tag header, forward upstream.
  * Rename 80_workaround_incorrect_directories.patch to
    04_fix_external_program_directories.patch and add patch tag header.
  * Rename 81_initial_server_on_vt7.patch to 05_initial_server_on_vt7.patch.
  * debian/rules: Remove /var/gdm (empty and nonstandard) and /var/run (will
    be created at runtime), thanks lintian.
  * debian/copyright: Point to versioned GPL, thanks lintian.
  * debian/gdm.postrm: Use "set -e" to conform to policy.
  * Add debian/xterm.desktop: Reintroduce "failsafe xterm" session.

gdm (2.26.1-0ubuntu7) karmic; urgency=low

  * Rename 04_xklavier4.patch to 00git-xklavier4.patch.
  * Add 04_polkit1.patch: Port to PolicyKit (which essentially means to rip
    out all PolicyKit code, since the backend now talks to the authentication
    agent itself).
  * debian/control: Drop polkit build dependency.
  * Add debian/patches/99_autoreconf.patch: Regenerate autotools files to pick
    up 04_polkit1.patch changes.

gdm (2.26.1-0ubuntu6) karmic; urgency=low

  * Add 00git-greeter-session-management.patch: Make the greeter a
    well-behaved session client. Patch taken from upstream git head.
  * Add 00git-use-after-free.patch: Fix crash in xdmcp chooser. Taken from
    upstream git head.
  * debian/control: Add libxklavier-dev build dependency, to get the
    keyboard selector.
  * Add 04_xklavier4.patch: Fix build with libxklavier 4.0. Taken from
    upstream git head.
  * Add 00git-invalid-dmrc-layout.patch: Correctly handle invalid xkb layout
    from ~/.dmrc. Taken from upstream git head.

gdm (2.26.1-0ubuntu5) karmic; urgency=low

  * debian/gdm.preinst: Remove obsolete conffiles.
  * debian/gdm.preinst: Migrate autologin settings from gdm.conf (which isn't
    read any more) to custom.conf. (LP: #396459)
  * Add 81_initial_server_on_vt7.patch: Force initial X server to go to tty7
    instead of tty1. This is an Ugly Hack until we have a cleaner solution for
    getty not to tramp over a running X server on vt1. This bandaids the
    immediate problem of the first X server being killed after a few minutes
    due to getty on tty1 timing out. (LP: #396226)

gdm (2.26.1-0ubuntu4) karmic; urgency=low

  * debian/gdm.preinst: Do not check for an existing custom.conf, since we
    already ship it. Always let the gdm.conf-custom win, to actually migrate
    settings.
  * debian/control: Drop alternative dependencies for gnome-session, since gdm
    itself now needs gnome-session. (LP: #396321).

gdm (2.26.1-0ubuntu3) karmic; urgency=low

  * Add 03_hide_system_users.patch: Do not show system users in the "frequent
    users" list. (LP: #395281)
  * debian/rules: Call dh_installinit with --no-scripts, to avoid restarting
    gdm (and killing your X session) during upgrade. The prerm/postinst
    scripts already have code to reload gdm if appropriate. Unfortunately this
    doesn't help to fix the upgrade from 0ubuntu2, its prerm already kills it.
    (LP: #395302) This also fixes the "locks session and spawns a second X
    server" issue on upgrades from Jaunty. (LP: #395313)
  * Drop 16_correct_customconf_naming.patch: Upstream uses
    and installs /etc/gdm/custom.conf, so gdm also needs to read this. Add
    debian/gdm.preinst to migrate the old name to the new name on upgrades.
    (LP: #395861)
  * 02_dont_force_us_keyboard.patch: Don't return NULL in
    get_default_layout(), but return an empty string and explicitly check this
    when setting $GDM_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT. With NULL, gdm trips over an assertion
    check. (LP: #395595)

gdm (2.26.1-0ubuntu2) karmic; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Add Vcs-Bzr, package imported into bzr.
  * Add 02_dont_force_us_keyboard.patch: Don't force GDM_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT=us if
    gdm does not have an explicit setting (which it currently doesn't, since
    there is not even an interface for changing the keyboard layout). Instead,
    let the GNOME session default to the very same system default as gdm
    itself. (LP: #395103)

gdm (2.26.1-0ubuntu1) karmic; urgency=low

  * Upload the new gdm codebase to karmic, there is several known issues but
    the new version need testing:
    - there is no graphical configure tool yet
    - gdm will not work correctly after upgrade until restart (restarting on
      upgrade is not possible since it would close running xsession)
    - the fast user switch applet ubuntu changes and the guest session
      have not been updated yet
