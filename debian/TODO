This file lists the most obvious breakages in GDM. There are probably a 
lot of bugs remaining after that, these are only the blockers.

 * Settings are not migrated.
   => There are so many regressions, we probably need to ship the new 
      version in a new package named e.g. gdm3.
 
 * GConf settings don’t work in the greeter.
   => Probably fixed by Ubuntu’s 04_fix_external_program_directories.patch

 * User switching is broken, two connections start two sessions.
   => Possibly fixed by Ubuntu’s 04_fix_external_program_directories.patch

 * The default session is always GNOME
   => Fixed by Ubuntu’s 15_default_session.patch

 * There is no configuration GUI
   => Ubuntu has one, in 08_use_polkit_for_settings.patch and 
      09_gdmsetup.patch.

 * gdmflexiserver is missing many options, including xnest.
   => Looks like Ubuntu has no bugs and GNOME has a sort of feature request,
      but no one replied for implementing it.
      Is "Login in a nested window" going to die?
   => It is easy to implement, but it will require extending the D-Bus 
      API so that gdmflexiserver has a way to communicate Xephyr’s 
      $DISPLAY to gdm.

 * Other Ubuntu patches we need
   - 13_cache_ck_history.patch for speed improvement
   - 19_no_greeter_for_autologin.patch, already fixed in git master
   - 23_login_window_hint.patch for a focus fix
