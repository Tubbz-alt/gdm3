Description: $GDM_LANG gets its value from accountsservice's "Language"
 property, and must not be assigned to $LANG in Ubuntu where it typically
 contains a language code (e.g. 'de' or 'en_GB') rather than a valid locale
 name. Besides, this late setting of a locale environment component would make
 it more difficult to fine-tune the settings manually via e.g. ~/.profile.
