Subject: XSession: Use x-terminal-emulator as fallback instead of xterm

Mimic debian's behavior here, to make sure we use the default terminal,
which these days points to gnome-terminal, as it may allow a better
experience especially when it comes to HiDPI monitors where xterm could be
barely visible and its text hard zoom from the UI.
